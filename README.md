# Brainrot
A Brainfuck interpreter/compiler written in C

The program will contain a interpreter and a compiler.
I started with the interpeter and the goal is to make brainrot run either the compiler or interpreter by passing command line flags.

## compile and run brainRot interpreter:
From the root folder, run: 'make'

#### launch repl
Execute the program with: ./brainrot

#### Execute source file
pass argument to brainrot: f.e. ./brainrot source.txt
